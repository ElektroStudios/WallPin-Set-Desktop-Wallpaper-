# WallPin

### A lightweight command-line utility to change the Windows desktop wallpaper with support for all layout styles (Fill, Fit, Center, etc.) and context menu integration via optional shell scripts.

------------------

## 👋 Introduction

**WallPin** lets you set any supported image as your Windows desktop wallpaper. It doesn't run in the background, it doesn't consume resources, and it works completely silently without even showing a console window. If an operation fails or the arguments are invalid, the tool will display a standard Windows message box showing the exact error details.

## 💡 Why WallPin?

I decided to develop this application because Windows 10 has a deeply annoying design flaw: when you use the built-in "Set as desktop background" menu command, Windows forces a global system refresh that resets the scrollbar position in all open File Explorer windows back to the very top.

If you are working inside a directory with thousands of files and you have an image selected near the middle or the bottom, Windows completely breaks your user experience by throwing you back to the top of the list. On top of that, the built-in menu command doesn't even let you choose the wallpaper style (Fill, Fit, Center, etc.).

**WallPin** solves both issues. It updates your desktop wallpaper instantly without affecting your open File Explorer windows, leaving your selection and scrollbars exactly where they are, and gives you full control over the wallpaper layout style.

## 👌 Features

- Supports `center`, `tile`, `stretch`, `fit`, `fill`, and `span` using either their names or standard Windows IDs.
- Includes a batch script to add a clean "Set as desktop background" sub-menu directly into the Windows Explorer right-click menu for supported image files.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Adding these registry keys does not delete or corrupt the original built-in Windows menu commands; it simply overrides them safely. A separate script is also included to easily remove WallPin's registry keys and restore built-in Windows menu commands back to its original state.
